# F-16-and-Boeing-787-Wind-Tunnel-Testing
Wind tunnel data taken for Boeing 787 and F-16 Fighting Falcon scaled-down models. Analysis was performed using Matlab to investigate the stability, performance, and landing speed characteristics of each design.

## Data Collection
All data was collected by undergraduate students in a low-speed wind tunnel provided by the University of Colorado Boulder. Models for the Boeing 787 (clean), F-16 (clean), and F-16 (dirty) were provided by ITLL Staff and the Aerospace Engineering department for experimental use.

## Model Configurations
+ The <strong>F-16 Dirty</strong> model includes external fuel stores, weaponry, and other military add-ons that are considered part of the "combat design"
+ The <strong>F-16 clean</strong> and <strong>Boeing 787 clean</strong> models do not include any extra add-ons and are considered the "stock design"

## Running the Code
To run the experimental code, run the "ExpLab1_Group29" main script. (Pictred below using the Command Window)

All other functions will be called from this script, and will load in the appropriate data automatically. Make sure <strong>data</strong> folder is downloaded with this project to load all experimental data taken for this experiment.
